 * machine.
 *
 * Behaviour is preserved from the old ProgressCard branches except that cancelled terminal states
 * now remain distinct from successful output-producing completion:
 *  - null            -> Idle    (no operation)
 *  - !done           -> Running (operation in progress; cancel affordance)
 *  - done && error   -> Failed  (carries the full AppError so ProgressCard can gate the
 *                                force-decrypt (DataCorruption) and password-retry (PasswordAuth)
 *                                buttons via allowsForceDecrypt()/allowsPasswordRetry())
 *  - done && status=Cancelled
 *                    -> Cancelled (terminal, but no successful output to save)
 *  - done && !error  -> Success (the "Completed" save dialog)
