# Downloads

ℹ️ **You are highly recommended to read through the [Features](https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG?tab=readme-ov-file#features) section below to fully understand the features and limitations of Picocrypt NG before using it.** ℹ️

Make sure to only download Picocrypt NG from this repository to ensure that you get the authentic and backdoor-free Picocrypt NG. When sharing Picocrypt NG with others, be sure to link to this repository to prevent any confusion.

## Windows
**Windows 10/11:** Download the latest <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-Setup.exe">installer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-portable.exe">portable executable</a>. A CLI-only Windows build is available <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-cli.exe">here</a>.

**Windows 7/8 (Legacy Systems):** The legacy release is CLI-only. If you're running Windows 7 or Windows 8, download the <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-cli-Legacy.exe">legacy CLI build</a> instead. This version includes:
- Compiled with [go-legacy-win7](https://github.com/thongtech/go-legacy-win7) for Windows 7/8 compatibility
- No GUI or OpenGL dependencies

⚠️ **Note:** The legacy build is for command-line use only. Use the standard installer or portable executable on Windows 10/11.

If your antivirus flags Picocrypt NG as a virus, please report it as a false positive to help everyone.

**Code signing:** Free Windows code signing for Picocrypt NG is provided by the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) open-source program (integration in progress).

## macOS
Download Picocrypt NG <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG.dmg">here</a>, open the container, and drag Picocrypt NG to your Applications.

Picocrypt NG is also available through the third-party MacPorts port:
```
sudo port install picocrypt-ng
```
This port is maintained outside this repository and is not published by the Picocrypt NG maintainers, so release timing, build flags, and packaging behavior are controlled by MacPorts and its maintainers.

**Apple Silicon vs Intel:** The released macOS app is built for Apple Silicon and targets macOS 15.0+. Intel Mac users and users on older macOS releases need to <a href="src/README.md">build from source</a> or use the CLI-only version where appropriate.

**Gatekeeper Warning:** The release is ad-hoc signed but not notarized (notarization needs a paid Apple Developer ID), so macOS shows a Gatekeeper warning the first time you open it. This is a Gatekeeper prompt, not a Picocrypt NG runtime error.

To open it, use one of these methods:
- **Right-click → Open** (instead of double-clicking), then confirm
- **System Settings → Privacy & Security** → scroll down → "Open Anyway"
- **Terminal:** `xattr -cr /Applications/Picocrypt-NG.app` — most reliable, and the fix if a re-download re-applies quarantine and you see "app is damaged and can't be opened"

The CLI-only build avoids the `.app` bundle path and is useful for terminal-only use.

## Linux
Download the raw binary for <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG">amd64</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-arm64">arm64</a> (you may need the packages below). CLI-only builds are also available for <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-cli">amd64</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-cli-arm64">arm64</a>. Alternatively, try the <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG.deb">.deb</a> or <a href="https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.github.picocrypt_ng.Picocrypt-NG">Flatpak</a>.
```
sudo apt install -y libc6 libgcc-s1 libgl1 libgtk-3-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6
```

## Android
The Android build is now a native app built from the `android/` project in this repository rather than a `fyne-cross` package. Download the signed universal APK <a href="https://github.com/Picocrypt-NG/Picocrypt-NG/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt-NG-android-universal.apk">here</a>, or choose a smaller per-ABI APK from the latest GitHub release. PR artifacts remain debug/testing-only.

For local Android builds and architecture details, see <a href="android/README.md">android/README.md</a>.

## CLI
Picocrypt NG includes a command-line interface in this repository; see <a href="CLI.md">CLI.md</a> for usage. It can encrypt and decrypt files, folders, and glob patterns, and supports paranoid mode and Reed-Solomon encoding. You can use it on systems that don't have a GUI or can't run the GUI app.

## Web
Picocrypt NG provides a browser app <a href="https://picocrypt-ng.github.io/">here</a> for in-memory single-file encryption and decryption on modern browsers, including mobile devices. In this repository, the WASM bridge caps inputs at 1 GiB and supports comments, Paranoid mode, keyfiles, Reed-Solomon payload protection, force decrypt, and deniability. The browser workflow is still intentionally non-streaming and single-file oriented; folder workflows, split volumes, and large streaming jobs remain desktop/CLI/native-app features. Go-owned byte buffers are wiped best-effort after use, but JavaScript engine copies and garbage-collected runtime copies cannot be guaranteed wiped.

## Translations
Picocrypt NG uses Hosted Weblate for community UI translations. Translation
work is reviewed before merge, and security-sensitive wording must preserve the
meaning documented in the
[translation guide](docs/localization/TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md).
The CLI remains English-only.

## File Associations
Double-click `.pcv` files to open Picocrypt NG in decrypt mode on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Installer/`.deb`/`.app` packages register the association automatically.

Keep in mind that while Picocrypt NG does most things better than other tools, it's not a one-size-fits-all and doesn't try to be. There are use cases such as full-disk encryption where VeraCrypt and BitLocker would be a better (and the only) choice. So while Picocrypt NG is a great choice for the majority of people doing file encryption, you should still do your own research and use what's best for you.

# Features
Picocrypt NG is a very simple tool and most users will intuitively understand how to use it in a few seconds. On a basic level, simply dropping your files, entering a password, and hitting Encrypt is all that's needed to encrypt your files. Dropping the output back into Picocrypt NG, entering the password, and hitting Decrypt is all that's needed to decrypt those files. Pretty simple, right?

While being simple, Picocrypt NG also strives to be powerful in the hands of knowledgeable and advanced users. Thus, there are some additional options that you may use to suit your needs. Read through their descriptions carefully as some of them can be complex to use correctly.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Password generator</strong>: Picocrypt NG provides a secure password generator that you can use to create cryptographically secure passwords. You can customize the password length, as well as the types of characters to include.</li>
	<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Comments are plaintext header metadata: they are not encrypted and must never contain secrets. In v2 volumes, comments are authenticated as part of header integrity, so tampering is detected during normal decryption. Legacy v1 volumes do not have v2 header authentication. <strong>Use comments only for non-sensitive, informational text.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Keyfiles</strong>: Picocrypt NG supports the use of keyfiles as an additional decryption factor (or the only decryption factor). Any file can be used as a keyfile, and a secure keyfile generator is provided for convenience. Not only can you use multiple keyfiles, but you can also require the correct order of keyfiles to be present for a successful decryption to occur. A particularly good use case of multiple keyfiles is creating a shared volume, where each person holds a keyfile, and all of them (and their keyfiles) must be present to decrypt the shared volume. By checking the "Require correct order" box and dropping your keyfile in last, you can also ensure that you'll always be the one clicking the Decrypt button. <strong>Use the keyfile generator whenever possible for the best security.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Paranoid mode</strong>: Paranoid mode increases the work factor and adds a Serpent-CTR layer plus HMAC-SHA3 authentication. It is useful for conservative defense in depth when performance cost is acceptable, assuming a strong password and a trusted endpoint. It does not make weak passwords safe and should not be described as beyond attack.</li>
	<li><strong>Reed-Solomon</strong>: Reed-Solomon adds error-correction redundancy so Picocrypt NG can detect and repair limited corruption. It cannot prevent corruption and cannot recover data after corruption exceeds the redundancy budget.</li>
	<li><strong>Force decrypt</strong>: Picocrypt NG automatically checks for file integrity upon decryption. If the file has been modified or is corrupted, Picocrypt NG will automatically delete the output for the user's safety. If you would like to override these safeguards, check this option. Also, if this option is checked and the Reed-Solomon feature was used on the encrypted volume, Picocrypt NG will attempt to recover as much of the file as possible during decryption.</li>
	<li><strong>Split into chunks</strong>: Don't feel like dealing with gargantuan files? No worries! With Picocrypt NG, you can choose to split your output file into custom-sized chunks, so large files can become more manageable and easier to upload to cloud providers. Simply choose a unit (KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB) and enter your desired chunk size for that unit. To decrypt the chunks, simply drag one of them into Picocrypt NG and the chunks will be automatically recombined during decryption.</li>
	<li><strong>Compress files</strong>: By default, Picocrypt NG uses a zip file with no compression to quickly merge files together when encrypting multiple files. If you would like to compress these files, however, simply check this box and the standard Deflate compression algorithm will be applied during encryption.</li>
	<li><strong>Deniability</strong>: Picocrypt NG volumes typically follow an easily recognizable header format. However, if you want to hide the fact that you are encrypting your files, enabling this option will provide you with plausible deniability. The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password. This can be useful in an authoritarian country where the only way to transport your files safely is if they don't "exist" in the first place. Keep in mind that this mode slows down encryption and decryption speeds, requires you to manually rename the volume afterward, renders comments useless, and also voids the extra security precautions of the paranoid mode, so you should only use it if absolutely necessary. <strong>If you've never heard of plausible deniability, this feature is not for you.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Recursively</strong>: If you want to encrypt and/or decrypt a large set of files individually, this option will tell Picocrypt NG to go through every recursive file that you drop in and encrypt/decrypt it separately. This is useful, for example, if you are encrypting thousands of large documents and want to be able to decrypt any one of them in particular without having to download and decrypt the entire set of documents. <strong>Keep in mind that this is a very complex feature that should only be used if you know what you are doing.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>File associations</strong>: Double-click <code>.pcv</code> files to open Picocrypt NG in decrypt mode. Setup.exe (Windows), <code>.deb</code> (Linux), and <code>.app</code> (macOS) register the association automatically.</li>
</ul>

# Security
For more information on how Picocrypt NG handles cryptography, see <a href="Internals.md">Internals</a> for the technical details.

<strong>Picocrypt NG operates under the assumption that the host machine it is running on is safe and trusted. If that is not the case, no piece of software will be secure, and you will have much bigger problems to worry about. As such, Picocrypt NG is designed for the offline security of volumes and does not attempt to protect against side-channel analysis.</strong>

# AI Usage

AI tools (LLMs) assist development in this project. The cryptographic core derives from the audited Picocrypt (Radically Open Security, 2024 — no major findings) and stays regression-pinned to the archived audited build and frozen golden vectors, so AI-assisted changes cannot silently alter the audited behavior or the volume format. All crypto-critical code receives human review before merging. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assistance) for details.

# FAQ
**Does the "Delete files" feature shred files?**

No, it doesn't shred any files and just deletes them as your file manager would. On modern storage mediums like SSDs, there is no such thing as shredding a file since wear leveling makes it impossible to overwrite a particular sector. Thus, to prevent giving users a false sense of security, Picocrypt NG doesn't include any shredding features at all.

**Is Picocrypt NG quantum-secure?**

Picocrypt NG uses symmetric cryptography with large security margins, which is generally less affected by known quantum speedups than public-key cryptography. This is not a guarantee against all future cryptanalytic developments; password strength and endpoint security still matter.
